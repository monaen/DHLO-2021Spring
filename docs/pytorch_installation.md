# PyTorch Installation

## Introduction
In this page, we are about to learn [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), a framework for building and training neural networks. **PyTorch** in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you learned from Numpy. All these arrays in PyTorch, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.


## Installation instruction
Install PyTorch package is simple with conda.
