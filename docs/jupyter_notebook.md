# Jupyter Notebooks

## Introduction
In this page we will introduce the [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). The notebook is a **web application** that allows you to combine plain text, math equations, code, and figures all in one easily sharable document. Notebooks have rapidly become an essential tool when working with big data. You'll find them being used for **data cleaning and exploration**, **visualization**, **machine learning**, and **big data analysis**. Here's an example notebook I made for my personal blog that shows off many of the features of notebooks. Typically you'd be doing this work in a terminal, either the normal Python shell or with IPython. Your visualizations would be in separate windows, any documentation would be in separate documents, along with various scripts for functions and classes. However, with notebooks, all of these are in one place and easily read together.

Notebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub. Itâ€™s a great feature that lets you easily share your work. There is also http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ that renders the notebooks from your GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere.


## Installing Jupyter Notebook
By far the easiest way to install Jupyter is with Anaconda. Jupyter notebooks automatically come with the distribution. You'll be able to use notebooks from the default environment.

To install Jupyter notebooks in a conda environment, use <code style="color:#fff;background-color:#2f3d48;border-radius: 4px;border: 1px solid #737b83;padding: 2px 4px">conda install jupyter notebook</code>.

Jupyter notebooks are also available through pip with <code style="color:#fff;background-color:#2f3d48;border-radius: 4px;border: 1px solid #737b83;padding: 2px 4px">pip install jupyter notebook</code>.
