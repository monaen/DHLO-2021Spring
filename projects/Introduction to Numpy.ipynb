    "You may be wondering why we use NumPy. After all, Python can handle lists, as you learned in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Speed**\n",
    "\n",
    "   When executing operations on large arrays, NumPy can often perform several **orders of magnitude faster** than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Another great feature of NumPy is that it has **multidimensional array data structures** that can represent vectors and matrices. Nowadays, a lot of machine learning algorithms rely on matrix operations. For example, when training a Neural Network, you often have to carry out many matrix multiplications. NumPy is optimized for matrix operations and it allows us to do Linear Algebra operations effectively and efficiently, making it very suitable for solving machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimized built-in mathematical functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Another great advantage of NumPy is that it has a large number of optimized built-in mathematical functions. These functions enable us to do a variety of complex mathematical computations very fast and with very little code (avoiding the use of complicated loops) making your programs more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just part of the key features that have made NumPy an essential package for scientific computing in Python. In fact, NumPy has become so popular that a lot of Python packages, such as Pandas, are built on top of NumPy."

    "Okay, now we introduce some useful terminology before we continue to learn. We refer to 1D arrays as rank 1 arrays. In general N-Dimensional arrays have rank N. Therefore, we refer to a 2D array as a rank 2 array. Another important property of arrays is their shape. The shape of an array is the size along each of its dimensions. For example, the shape of a rank 2 array will correspond to the number of rows and columns of the array. As you will see, NumPy ndarrays have attributes that allows us to get information about them in a very intuitive way. For example, the shape of an ndarray can be obtained using the .shape attribute. The shape attribute returns a tuple of N positive integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. In the example below we will create a rank 1 array and learn how to obtain its shape, its type, and the data-type (dtype) of its elements."
