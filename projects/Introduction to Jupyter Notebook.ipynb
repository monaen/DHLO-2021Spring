    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In this script we will introduce the [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). The notebook is a **web application** that allows you to combine plain text, math equations, code, and figures all in one easily sharable document. Notebooks have rapidly become an essential tool when working with big data. You'll find them being used for **data cleaning and exploration**, **visualization**, **machine learning**, and **big data analysis**. Here's an example notebook I made for my personal blog that shows off many of the features of notebooks. Typically you'd be doing this work in a terminal, either the normal Python shell or with IPython. Your visualizations would be in separate windows, any documentation would be in separate documents, along with various scripts for functions and classes. However, with notebooks, all of these are in one place and easily read together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub. Itâ€™s a great feature that lets you easily share your work. There is also http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ that renders the notebooks from your GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere."

    "## 3. How notebooks work\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks grew out of the [IPython project](https://ipython.org) started by Fernando Perez. IPython is an interactive shell, similar to the normal Python shell but with great features like syntax highlighting and code completion. Originally, notebooks worked by sending messages from the web app (the notebook you see in the browser) to an IPython kernel (an IPython application running in the background). The kernel executed the code, then sent it back to the notebook. The current architecture is similar, drawn out below.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The central point is the notebook server. You connect to the server through your browser and the notebook is rendered as a web app. Code you write in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel. The kernel runs the code and sends it back to the server, then any output is rendered back in the browser. When you save the notebook, it is written to the server as a JSON file with a <code style=\"color:#fff;background-color:#2f3d48;border-radius: 4px;border: 1px solid #737b83;padding: 2px 4px\">.ipynb</code> file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great part of this architecture is that the kernel doesn't need to run Python. Since the notebook and the kernel are separate, code in any language can be sent between them. For example, two of the earlier non-Python kernels were for the [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Julia](http://julialang.org) languages. With an R kernel, code written in R will be sent to the R kernel where it is executed, exactly the same as Python code running on a Python kernel. IPython notebooks were renamed because notebooks became language agnostic. The new name **Jupyter** comes from the combination of **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**. If you're interested, here's a [list of available kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit is that the server can be run anywhere and accessed via the internet. Typically you'll be running the server on your own machine where all your data and notebook files are stored. But, you could also [set up a server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html) on a remote machine or cloud instance like Amazon's EC2. Then, you can access the notebooks in your browser from anywhere in the world."
