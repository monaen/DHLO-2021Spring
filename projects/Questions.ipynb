    "This is because most of the packages are built based on the NumPy. For example, when working with images, the first step is to read the images into your program, and usually, this image is stored in a variable as **ndarray**. Then, you probably need to perform some processing operation on the images, for example, you may want to change the size of image, rotate the image, change its contrast, or cut off the black border of the image, etc. And those operations are more convenient if you use the NumPy package. Also, after the processing you probably need to visualize the results, and visualization packages, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are also support NumPy. So, generally, NumPy is widely-used in most of the cases if your project involves numerical calculation or operation."
