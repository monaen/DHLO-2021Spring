    "Python provides many packages to support numerical calculations. In practice, however, besides operating on numbers, in some cases we have to work with images. This is the time for us to use the visualization packages. In this script, we will introduce two frequently-used packages to process images, i.e., Seaborn and Matplotlib. Let's go through the tutorials step by step to see the functions of these two packages and figure out what we can do with these two packages."

You should be comfortable with reshaping your data or perform transformations to split or combine features in your data, resulting in new data columns. This work should be performed in the wrangling stage of the data analysis process, so if you need to know more about these operations, it is recommended that you refer back to the data wrangling content from earlier in the program."
